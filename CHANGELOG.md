# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), where
the public surface is the CLI's flags and the JSON report schema — not the
Python API, which is internal.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md`,
  `docs/RELEASING.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Property-based tests (Hypothesis) over the parsers, the safety predicates and
  the version comparator (ADR-0019).
- Architecture contracts enforced by `import-linter`: the functional core may
  not import the imperative shell, and the runtime may not import a third-party
  package (ADR-0020).
- `iemod_fetch/urls.py` — pure URL facts, extracted from `resolvers`.
- CI/CD: lint, typecheck, architecture, test matrix, coverage floor, security
  scanning, SBOM, build provenance and signed releases.

### Fixed
- **Version comparison was not antisymmetric.** Two spellings of the same
  stability level (`master`/`main`, `alpha`/`a`, `rc`/`pre`) each compared as
  *newer than the other*, so `is_newer` was true in both directions and an
  upstream renaming its default branch could mark a rule stale on the rename
  alone. Found by property-based testing, not by any example test.
- Archive extraction no longer hands an unvalidated member list back to the
  standard library: entries are extracted one at a time and the resolved
  destination is re-checked before each write.
- A manifest invariant in the pinned-manifest generator was an `assert`, which
  `python -O` strips. It is a raised `ManifestError` now.
- Two tests leaked file handles, surfaced by promoting warnings to errors.
- `catalogues` no longer reaches into `resolvers` through a function-local
  import to dodge an import cycle.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Component-level conflict reporting: which component of which mod fights which
  component of which other mod, with the upstream's evidence grade and source,
  and the narrowest remedy (ADR-0018).
- Whole-install order planning: `--plan-order` writes a rule-compliant
  `WeiDU.log` + `WeiDU-BGEE.log` pair and verifies the result against the same
  rules that judged the input (ADR-0017).
- Install-order, incompatibility and dependency checking against BigWorldSetup
  Next-Generation and krion64 rule data, with staleness detection (ADR-0015,
  ADR-0016).
- `.iemod` / Project Infinity metadata parsing, and `.tp2` introspection for the
  installed version and supported games.
- INI configuration file with documented precedence, `expect_tp2` manifest
  override, trusted-owner release discovery, LCC catalogue enrichment,
  `--emit-pinned-manifest`, and a single-file `zipapp` build.

### Changed
- Complete rewrite of the original single-file script. The original is kept in
  `legacy/` so its defects stay reproducible (ADR-0001).

### Security
- HTTPS enforced including across redirects; the GitHub credential is never
  attached to a non-GitHub host; archives are size-, ratio- and traversal-checked
  before extraction; downloads are verified against a pinned `sha256` when the
  manifest carries one.
